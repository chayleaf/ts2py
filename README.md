# ts2py

A basic JavaScript/TypeScript to Python converter. This won't produce
working code because I obviously don't plan to port all of node.js to
Python, but it will translate the JS/TS AST to Python AST and serialize
it using [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

## Usage

Change the file path in main.rs and run using `cargo run`.
